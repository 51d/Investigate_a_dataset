Investigate a dataset
This project involves the use of NumPy, Pandas, MatPlotlib, Seaborn and Python to analyse a dataset. 
The dataset I choose was the Titanic Dataset provided by Kaggle.

1-copy of the dataset "titanic_data.csv"
2-HTML version of the report "Titanic Dataset Investigation.html"
3-iPython notebook - used to generate the report "Titanic Dataset Investigation.ipynb"
